## 🧠 Overview

**Mini Semantic Search Graph** is an **experimental project** built during internal R&D testing.  
We started with a **small base of clustered keywords**, each cluster representing a thematic category.  
Initially, we tested two approaches for semantic retrieval:

1. **Pure Embeddings + Cosine Similarity** — a direct method comparing the article vector with all keyword embeddings.  
2. **FAISS HNSW Graph** — an approximate nearest-neighbor search over all keyword vectors.

Both methods produced **strong and meaningful results** in terms of semantic relevance.  
However, as the number of keywords increased, the **FAISS graph performed better**,  
mainly due to its **speed and scalability**, allowing efficient searches even with thousands of entries.  

In summary: *for smaller datasets, both work equally well;  
for larger keyword bases, the FAISS-based approach is faster and more robust.*


## ⚙️ What It Does

The app lets you:
- 🔍 Enter a **phrase**, **full article**, or a **.txt file**
- ✨ Optionally summarize it with **GPT-4o** or **GPT-4o-mini** before searching
- 🧾 Retrieve the **most relevant keywords** from your dataset
